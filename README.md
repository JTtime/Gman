# Gman
Geektrust Gman Coding challenge

This is my first attempt of writing code in my life. AFter testing on "Test Code" on Geektrust, it gave me improvement pointers on readability and OOPS.
After surfing internet, I am learning to improve code readability by changing variable names as per conventions and also fine tuning on OOPS implementation.
First thing that I could notice is there are too many properties in Gman Class related to Power Turn. Because they are all declared as int, I cannot pass such variables by reference but by value in Java. So, I decided to create wrapper Object (Integer) for Power utilised in turns, so that I can pass object by reference and instead of using so many different variables, I will have single variable whose value will be updated directly by methods.
If there is any more suggestion on improving my code in any context, please feel free to comment

Thanks and Regards
